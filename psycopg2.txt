1. First, you need to install the "psycopg2" package, which is a PostgreSQL adapter for Python. It is the most popular PostgreSQL database adapter for the Python programming language

-> pip install psycopg2-binary
The -binary version includes pre-built binaries for the package so you don't need to build it from source.

2. Gather Your Database Credentials
    Before you can connect to your AWS RDS PostgreSQL instance, you need the following details:

    Hostname (Endpoint of the RDS instance)
    Port (Usually 5432 for PostgreSQL)
    Database name
    Username
    Password

    After u have collected these details, paste them into .env file
        -> pip install python-dotenv  (to deal with .env files)
    Then access the credentials from .env file (it is a good practice)
    The reason to put it into a .env file is bcoz i can add this into .gitignore so the credentials won't be pushed to the codebase
